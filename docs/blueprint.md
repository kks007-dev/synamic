# **App Name**: Synamic

## Core Features:

- Calendar Integration: Integrate with Google Calendar to fetch existing events and commitments. Provide controls so the user can limit the integration if necessary, only pulling data from calendars they select.
- Priority Assessment: Use an AI tool to help users identify their priorities for the day, even if the user is unsure. Allow the user to reshuffle or override the AI's suggestions.
- Schedule Generation: Based on user priorities and calendar events, generate an optimized daily schedule using an AI tool, including time blocks for learning or other goals.
- Schedule Customization: Allow users to view, edit, and reshuffle their generated schedule, providing manual control over the AI's suggestions.
- Calendar Sync: Enable users to sync the finalized schedule back to their Google Calendar, creating or updating events as needed.
- Dynamic Reworking: If the user deviates from the schedule, the AI tool can dynamically adjust the remaining schedule based on the user's new constraints. The tool should reprioritize, shift tasks, or suggest alternative activities to stay aligned with the user's goals.
- Future Planning: Enable planning for the next day or week, with options to replicate or randomize the schedule.
